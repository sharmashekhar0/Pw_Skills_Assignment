Explanation of how i have named the classes
    
Explanation: I have used BEM naming convention for naming the classes.

    For block tags:
        Block names may consist of Latin letters, digits, and dashes. To form a CSS class, add a short prefix for namespacing: ".name"

    For element tags:
        Element names may consist of Latin letters, digits, dashes and underscores. CSS class is formed as block name plus two underscores plus element name: .block__elem.

    For Modifier:
        Modifier names may consist of Latin letters, digits, dashes and underscores. CSS class is formed as block’s or element’s name plus two dashes: .block--mod or .block__elem--mod and .block--color-black with .block--color-red. Spaces in complicated modifiers are replaced by dash.
