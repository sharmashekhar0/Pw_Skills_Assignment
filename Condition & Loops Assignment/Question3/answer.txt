Question: What are loops, and what do we need them? Explain different types of loops with their syntax and
examples.

Answer:
Loops in JavaScript, as in other programming languages, are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met. They are essential for handling tasks that require repetitive actions or for iterating through collections of data. JavaScript supports several types of loops, including the for loop, while loop, and do-while loop.

Explanations of each type of loop with their syntax and examples:

1. For Loop:
Syntax:
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
    // Code to be repeated
}

Example:
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}

2. While Loop:
Syntax:
while (condition) {
    // Code to be repeated
}

Example:
let count = 0;
while (count < 5) {
    console.log(count);
    count++;
}

3. Do-While Loop:
Syntax:
do {
    // Code to be repeated
} while (condition);

Example:
let count = 0;
do {
    console.log(count);
    count++;
} while (count < 5);
