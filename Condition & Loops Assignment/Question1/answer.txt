Question: What are conditional statements? Explain conditional statements with syntax and examples.

Answer:
Conditional statements in programming are constructs that allow the execution of different code blocks based on whether a specified condition evaluates to true or false. These statements enable developers to create decision-making structures in their code, allowing it to adapt and respond to different scenarios. The most common types of conditional statements are if, else if, and else.

Explanation of these statements along with their syntax and examples:

1. if Statement:
The if statement is used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true.
Syntax:
if (condition) {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is true
}

Example:
let age = 20;

if (age >= 18) {
    console.log('You are eligible to vote.');
}

2. if-else Statement:
The if-else statement allows you to execute one block of code if the condition is true and another block if the condition is false.

Syntax:
if (condition) {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is false
}

Example:
let temperature = 25;

if (temperature > 30) {
    console.log('It\'s hot outside.');
} else {
    console.log('The weather is moderate.');
}

3. if-else if-else Statement:
The if-else if-else statement allows you to check multiple conditions and execute different code blocks based on the first true condition encountered.

Syntax:
if (condition1) {
    // Code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
    // Code to be executed if condition2 is true
} else {
    // Code to be executed if none of the conditions is true
}

Example:
let time = 14;

if (time < 12) {
    console.log('Good morning!');
} else if (time < 18) {
    console.log('Good afternoon!');
} else {
    console.log('Good evening!');
}

4. Nested if Statements:
You can nest if statements inside each other to create more complex decision structures.

Example:
let num = 15;

if (num > 0) {
    if (num % 2 === 0) {
        console.log('The number is positive and even.');
    } else {
        console.log('The number is positive and odd.');
    }
} else {
    console.log('The number is not positive.');
}
