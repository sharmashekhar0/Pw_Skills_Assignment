        <h2>Feature 1: Semantic elements</h2>
        <p>HTML5 introduced semantic elements like &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt; that provide a clearer structure to web documents. These elements help improve accessibility and SEO by conveying the meaning of different parts of the page.</p>

        <h2>Feature 2: Multimedia Support</h2>
        <p>&lt;audio&gt; and &lt;video&gt; elements allow embedding audio and video content directly into web pages without replying on third party plugins.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="feature3">
        <h2>Feature 3: Local Storage</h2>
