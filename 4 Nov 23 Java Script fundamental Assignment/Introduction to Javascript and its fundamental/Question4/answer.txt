Question: What is the purpose of declaring variables in JavaScript, and how do you declare them using the
'let' keyword?

Answer: 
In JavaScript, variables are used to store and manage data during the execution of a program. Declaring variables allows you to allocate memory for a specific identifier (variable name) and associate it with a value or an object. Variables provide a way to store and retrieve data, making your code more flexible and dynamic.

--The let keyword is used to declare variables in JavaScript.

Example: 
let variableName; // Declaration without initialization
let age = 25; // Declaration and initialization

Key points about declaring variables with let:

1. Block Scope:
Variables declared with let have block scope, meaning they are only accessible within the block (pair of curly braces) where they are defined.
This is in contrast to the var keyword, which has function scope.

2. Reassignment:
Variables declared with let can be reassigned to new values.
Example:
let count = 1;
count = count + 1; // Reassignment is allowed
