Question: Explain the usage of ternary operator with syntax and write a program to check whether the number is even
or odd using the ternary operator.

Answer: 
The ternary operator is a concise way to write conditional statements in JavaScript. It's often used as a shorthand for simple if-else statements. 

Syntax of the ternary operator:
	Condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse;

Here, condition is evaluated. If it's true, expressionIfTrue is executed; otherwise, expressionIfFalse is executed.

Program:
function checkEvenOrOdd(number) {
    const result = number % 2 === 0 ? 'Even' : 'Odd';
    return result;
}

const numberToCheck = 15;
const resultMessage = checkEvenOrOdd(numberToCheck);

console.log(`The number ${numberToCheck} is ${resultMessage}.`);
