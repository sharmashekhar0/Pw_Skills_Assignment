Question: Explain what version control is and its importance in software development

Answer:
Version Control: Version control, also known as source control or revision control, is a system that manages changes to computer programs, documents, or any collection of files. Its primary purpose is to track and manage different versions of a project, enabling collaboration among multiple contributors, maintaining a history of changes, and facilitating the coordination of development efforts.

Importance of Version Control in Software Development:

1. Collaboration: Version control enables multiple developers to work on the same project concurrently. Each developer can have their own branch to make changes independently, and these changes can be later merged into the main codebase.

2. History and Auditing: Version control systems keep a detailed history of all changes made to the project. This history includes information about who made the changes, when the changes were made, and the nature of the changes. This audit trail is valuable for troubleshooting, accountability, and understanding the evolution of the project.

3. Branching and Experimentation: Developers can create branches to work on new features or experimental changes without affecting the main codebase. This promotes a more organized and controlled development process.

4. Conflict Resolution: When multiple developers make changes to the same file simultaneously, conflicts may arise. Version control systems provide tools to detect and resolve these conflicts, ensuring that changes are integrated smoothly.

5. Reproducibility: With version control, it's possible to reproduce any previous version of the project, making it easier to identify and fix bugs or roll back to a stable state if needed.
