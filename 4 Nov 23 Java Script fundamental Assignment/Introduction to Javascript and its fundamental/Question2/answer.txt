Question: Explain the key differences between JavaScript and HTML. Provide examples of situations where
you would use each.

Answer: 
JavaScript:

Purpose:
JavaScript is a scripting language used for adding interactivity, dynamic behavior, and client-side scripting to web pages.

Execution Environment:
JavaScript code is executed in the browser, typically by a JavaScript engine embedded in web browsers.

Syntax:
JavaScript uses a programming language syntax, consisting of variables, functions, loops, and conditional statements.

Example Use Cases:
-Adding dynamic content to a webpage based on user interactions.
-Handling form validations on the client side.
-Creating interactive elements such as sliders, dropdowns, and accordions.
-Making asynchronous requests to fetch data from a server (AJAX).
-Implementing client-side routing in a single-page application.

HTML:

Purpose:
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language used for structuring content on the web.

Execution Environment:
HTML is not a programming language; it is a markup language that provides structure to content on a webpage.

Syntax:
HTML uses tags to define elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and more. It doesn't involve programming logic.

Example Use Cases:
-Defining the structure of a webpage using elements like <html>, <head>, <body>, <header>, <footer>, etc.
-Creating paragraphs with <p> tags, headings with <h1> to <h6> tags.
-Inserting images with <img> tags.
-Including hyperlinks with <a> tags.
-Organizing content into lists using <ul>, <ol>, and <li> tags.

Key Differences:

Nature:
JavaScript is a programming language used for scripting and dynamic behavior.

HTML is a markup language used for structuring content.
Execution:

JavaScript code is executed in the browser by a JavaScript engine.
HTML is interpreted by the browser to structure content and display it.

Responsibility:
JavaScript is responsible for adding interactivity and client-side 
functionality.
HTML is responsible for defining the structure and content of a webpage.

Example Use Cases:
-Use JavaScript when you need to handle user interactions, perform validations, update content dynamically, or make asynchronous requests.
-Use HTML when you want to define the structure of your webpage, organize content, and provide semantics to the information.

Example Scenarios:

Use JavaScript:
-When you want to create a slideshow that automatically cycles through images.
-Implementing a form that validates user input before submission.
-Building a real-time chat application that updates messages without reloading the page.

Use HTML:
-Defining the overall structure of a webpage, including headers, paragraphs, and images.
-Creating a navigation menu with hyperlinks.
-Organizing a blog post with headings, paragraphs, and lists.
