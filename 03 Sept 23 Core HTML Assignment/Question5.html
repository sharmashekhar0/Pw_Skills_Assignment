        <dt>HTML</dt>
        <dd>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the foundational language of the World Wide Web. It is used to structure web content by employing a system of tags to define elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more. These tags provide a hierarchical structure for web pages, ensuring proper rendering and accessibility across browsers. HTML plays a crucial role in creating the structure and layout of web documents, serving as the backbone for websites and enabling seamless interaction between users and online content.</dd>
        <dt>CSS</dt>
        <dd>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used alongside HTML to control the presentation and design of web content. It allows web developers to apply styles such as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning to HTML elements, ensuring consistent and visually appealing web pages. CSS uses a rule-based system where selectors target specific HTML elements, and declarations define how those elements should appear. By separating content (HTML) from presentation (CSS), it enables flexible and responsive web design, making it easier to create visually engaging and user-friendly websites.</dd>
        <dt>Javascript</dt>
        <dd>JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language primarily used for web development. It enables the creation of interactive and dynamic elements within web pages. Developers can use JavaScript to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), allowing real-time updates and user interactions like form validation, animations, and asynchronous data retrieval. JavaScript is executed in the browser, making it a client-side scripting language, but it can also be used on the server-side with technologies like Node.js. Its wide adoption and extensive libraries and frameworks make JavaScript an essential tool for creating rich, interactive, and responsive web applications.</dd>
        <dt>React.js</dt>
        <dd>React.js is a JavaScript library for building interactive and reusable web user interfaces. It uses a component-based approach and a virtual DOM for efficient updates, making it a popular choice for modern web development.</dd>
        <dt>Node.js</dt>
        <dd>Node.js is a runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript on the server side. It's known for its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, making it efficient for building scalable and high-performance web applications. Node.js is commonly used for building server-side APIs, real-time applications, and handling asynchronous tasks, making it a versatile choice for backend development.</dd>
        <dt>Express.js</dt>
        <dd>Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework. It simplifies the creation of web servers and APIs by providing a robust set of features for routing, handling requests and responses, and managing middleware. With its lightweight and unopinionated design, Express.js is widely adopted for building scalable and fast web applications and RESTful APIs.</dd>
        <dt>MonjoDB</dt>
        <dd>MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database management system that stores data in a flexible, document-based format, using JSON-like documents. It's known for its scalability and flexibility, making it suitable for handling large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data. MongoDB is often used in modern web applications and other scenarios where data needs to be stored, retrieved, and queried quickly and efficiently.</dd>
