Question. What is SEO and explain the importance of SEO?

Answer. SEO stands for "Search Engine Optimization," is a set of strategies and techniques used to make a website or online content more visible and attractive to search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo. The goal of SEO is to improve a website's ranking in search engine results pages (SERPs) when people search for specific keywords or phrases related to the content on that website.

Importance of SEO:-

1. Increased Visibility: When someone searches for information, products, or services online, they usually click on one of the top results on the search page. SEO helps your website get to those top positions, making it more likely that people will find and visit your site.

2. More Traffic: Higher visibility means more people coming to your website. This is important because it can lead to more potential customers, readers, or users interacting with your content or products.

3. Credibility and Trust: Websites that appear at the top of search results are often seen as more trustworthy and credible. Good SEO practices can help establish your website's authority and reputation in your field.

4. Cost-Effective Marketing: Compared to many other forms of online advertising, SEO can be very cost-effective in the long run. Once you've optimized your site, you don't need to pay for every click or impression like you do with paid advertising.

5. Competitive Advantage: If your competitors are investing in SEO and you're not, they may outrank you in search results, stealing potential customers or readers from you. SEO helps you stay competitive in the online world.

6. Measurable Results: You can track and measure the results of your SEO efforts. This allows you to see what's working and what needs improvement, helping you make informed decisions to continually enhance your online presence.
