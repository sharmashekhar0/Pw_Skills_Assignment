Question: Explain the Git Workflow, including the staging area, working directory, and repository

Answer: 
Git Workflow Overview:

1. Working Directory:
Local file system containing project files.
Changes are recognized as "unstaged" modifications.

2. Staging Area (Index):
Intermediate area for selectively choosing changes for the next commit.
Changes are moved from the working directory to the staging area using git add.

3. Repository:
Permanent storage for the project's history.
Commits are snapshots with unique identifiers and metadata.
git commit saves staged changes to the repository.

Typical Git Workflow:

1. Modify Files:
Make changes in the working directory.

2. Stage Changes:
Use git add to selectively stage changes.

3. Commit Changes:
Use git commit to save staged changes to the repository.

4. Branching and Merging:
Use branches for independent work.
Merge branches with git merge.

5. Push and Pull:
Push changes to share.
Pull changes to incorporate updates.
